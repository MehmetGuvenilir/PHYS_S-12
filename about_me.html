	<h1>About me</h1>
	<h3>Hi everyone, <br><br>
	   My name is Mehmet Erhan Güvenilir. I am from Istanbul, Turkey. I will be in 12th grade next year, and wanted to take this course due to my interest in engineering. <br>I want to study mechanical engineering and electrical engineering in university. I really love music and sports; I have been boxing and working out for the past 5 years,<br> and I played the electric guitar for 4 years. I have also been working on robotics projects for the past three years, and I believe that this course is the perfect opportunity <br> for me to improve my skills on various topics. I am really looking forward to the courses, and the projects.</h3>

	   <h1>Final Project Ideas</h1>
	   <p>I am still not sure about what I am going to do for the final project, but these are some of the ideas that I had...</p>
	   <h3>1. Miniature Wind Turbine for AC Fans:</h3>

	   		<p> The idea for this project is to design a small scale savonius wind turbine which would be placed next to the fan of an AC unit. An additional component would be designed to increase the velocity of the air coming out of the fan, and direct it towards the wind turbine. The turbine would store electric energy, and this design would allow people to save energy by just placing this product in appropriate places. I was also planning on reading data (speed of the air, the amount of electric energy generated and its distribution throughout the year, etc.) from these turbines to do different researches in the future.</p>

	   <h3>2. Sports Timer Bracelet:</h3>

	   <p> During more intense workouts, it gets easy for the athlethes to lose track of time and take too long rest breaks. This project would be a bracelet (kind of like a smart watch) specifically for working out. You would be able to design your own workout programs from its database, and the bracelet would alert the user according to the optimum rest times for each specific movement, and the expertise of the user. The bracelet could also track the heartbeat of the user through sensor implemented in it, and notify the user if there are any potential health problems. The bracelet would be designed so that it would be comfortable to wear during a workout.</p>

	   <h3>3. Customizable Prosthetic Arm:</h3>

	   <p> The aim of this project is to design a prosthetic arm that the user could modify according to his/her own priorities, and comfort. There would be some functions of the prosthetic that can be utilized through the buttons on the design, and the function of these buttons could be altered by the user through the program. This would allow the user of the prosthetic arm to perform several actions without being strictly forced to use one specific prosthetic design. </p>
