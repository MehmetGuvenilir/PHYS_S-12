	<h1>About me</h1>
	<h3>Hi everyone, <br><br>
	   My name is Mehmet Erhan Güvenilir. I am from Istanbul, Turkey. I will be in 12th grade next year, and wanted to take this course due to my interest in engineering. <br>I want to study mechanical engineering and electrical engineering in university. I really love music and sports; I have been boxing and working out for the past 5 years,<br> and I played the electric guitar for 4 years. I have also been working on robotics projects for the past three years, and I believe that this course is the perfect opportunity <br> for me to improve my skills on various topics. I am really looking forward to the courses, and the projects.</h3>
